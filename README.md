# FICO-Score-Analysis-Project
This project showcases advanced Excel data analysis techniques, including workbook linking, dynamic data synchronization, and FICO score evaluation. This repository highlights essential Excel skills for handling financial datasets, producing insights, and creating dynamic reports.

**Skills Demonstrated**
- **Data Cleaning:** Optimizing client names and creating unique IDs.
- **Data Transformation:** Splitting and organizing data columns.
- **Advanced Functions:** Leveraging Excel functions like `TEXTJOIN`, `UNIQUE`, `SORT`, `INDEX`, and `DAVERAGE`.
- **Filtering and Analysis:** Isolating data for specific credit score categories (e.g., Exceptional, Very Good).
- **Dynamic Lookups:** Building a system to retrieve and analyze client data dynamically.
- **Visualization:** Creating a line chart to depict FICO score trends.
- Key Features**

### 1. **Data Cleaning and Organization**
- Converted names from uppercase to proper case for readability.
- Generated unique client IDs by combining initials, old IDs, and last name data.

### **Purpose of the Line Chart Visualization**

1. **Track Performance Over Time**:  
   The line chart visually depicts how the client's FICO score has fluctuated across the year, providing insights into their credit trends.

2. **Highlight Patterns**:  
   It helps identify patterns such as:
   - Consistent improvement
   - Decline in credit scores
   - Erratic behavior in creditworthiness

3. **Dynamic Representation**:  
   The chart dynamically updates based on the client ID entered, allowing personalized insights for each client.

### **Why This is Important**  
This line chart is crucial for:
- **Analyzing Financial Health**: Spotting trends that impact creditworthiness.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying potential risks or areas of improvement in a client's financial behavior.
- **Enhanced Decision-Making**: The visualization adds an interactive layer, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and act on the data.
