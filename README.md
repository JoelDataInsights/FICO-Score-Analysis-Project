# FICO-Score-Analysis-Project
This project showcases advanced Excel data analysis techniques, including workbook linking, dynamic data synchronization, and FICO score evaluation. This repository highlights essential Excel skills for handling financial datasets, producing insights, and creating dynamic reports.

**Skills Demonstrated**
- **Data Cleaning:** Optimizing client names and creating unique IDs.
- **Data Transformation:** Splitting and organizing data columns.
- **Advanced Functions:** Leveraging Excel functions like `TEXTJOIN`, `UNIQUE`, `SORT`, `INDEX`, and `DAVERAGE`.
- **Filtering and Analysis:** Isolating data for specific credit score categories (e.g., Exceptional, Very Good).
- **Dynamic Lookups:** Building a system to retrieve and analyze client data dynamically.
- **Visualization:** Creating a line chart to depict FICO score trends.
